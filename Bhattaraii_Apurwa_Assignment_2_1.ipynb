What I got back then was a quality jacket but one that could be a bit uncomfortable to wear given that the arms were insulated with a weird material and it also ran quite small. Still, I rather liked it and thought it looked really nice, so I wore it until I put on some weight and outgrew it.Eventually ordered a new one in XXL, which is what I order in jackets now because I like them to be a little loose and baggy when I'm at work, my t-shirt size is XL. New version of the jacket is of even higher quality. The material it's made of still feels strong but is very very smooth almost like suede, and the arm insultation is vastly better. The XXL feels like it ran a little big this time, as it's quite loose on me now, moreso than other jackets I order in that size, but for me this is fine. I could easily wear a big sweater or hoodie with it in cold weather and still fit comfortably. If you're unsure, I would say you would likely be safe ordering this in your usual size even if you like things to hang a little looser. I bought the brown/'tobacco' color and it is an extremely attractive jacket I feel like I could wear a lot of places from my messy custodial job to mountain hiking to dinner at like a sit down sushi place. It's of a quality and appearance that I feel you could wear this on a date or a night out and you would look quite nice. The buttons look quite nice and are kind of a weathered brass look. Previous jacket had a problem with the wrist buttons coming undone constantly, seems to be fixed in this one. The flannel insulation is not thick and I would consider this more of a spring/fall jacket, but I could easily layer it if the temperatures dropped.\",\n          \"The Legendary Whitetails Journeyman Shirt Jacket is the perfect fusion of functionality and fashion, making it an indispensable piece for the fall wardrobe. Designed with the outdoors in mind, this flannel-lined \\\"shacket\\\" offers the ideal balance between the warmth of a jacket and the comfort of a shirt, catering to men who value both style and practicality.One of the Journeyman's standout features is its water-resistant coating, which provides ample protection against light rain and mist, making it a reliable companion for outdoor adventures.
